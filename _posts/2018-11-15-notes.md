* (Spriting)[https://http2-explained.haxx.se/content/en/part3.html#31-spriting]
Spriting is the term often used to describe combining multiple small images to form a single larger image. Then, using JavaScript or CSS, you “cut out” pieces of that big image to show smaller individual ones.  
 - Pros: Single big image in HTTP 1.1 is much faster than getting 100 smaller individual ones.
 - Cons: 
  - For the pages of the site that only want to show one or two of the small pictures need to load a big image.
  - Spriting also causes all images to be removed simultaneously when the cache is cleared instead of possibly letting the most commonly used ones remain.
